The Weather Application in React.js is a web-based platform that provides real-time weather information to users based on their location or a manually entered location. This application leverages React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create a dynamic and responsive user experience. The application uses external APIs to fetch weather data and presents it in a user-friendly manner.
